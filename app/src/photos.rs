//! Contact photos, for the thread list's rows and the conversation's

//! The photos stay on disk. A row asks for a texture and the conversation
//! for a `data:` URI, by address; the first ask reads the file off the GTK
//! thread, and whoever listens hears which addresses arrived, so only the
//! rows and pages showing them are drawn again. What was read is kept the
//! most recently used first, up to a number of bytes, and a photo larger
//! than a face is ever drawn is shrunk first: a contact photo can be a
//! 4 MB camera picture, and the row shows it 34 pixels wide.
